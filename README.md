A simple pet appointments app built with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/). The idea was to build a simple app that helps pet doctors or hospitals manage their pet appointments.

Here is a link to the demo site [https://pet-appointments-app.vercel.app](https://pet-appointments-app.vercel.app).

## Getting Started

Install dependecies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Running tests

To run test, run:

```bash
npm run test
# or
yarn test
```
